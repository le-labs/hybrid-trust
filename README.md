# Hybrid Trust PKI
The solution contains a smart contract: `HybridTrustPLPKI.sol`, and for demonstration purposes a Jupyter script: `HybridTrustPLPKI.ipynb`.

To run the demonstration, create a virtual environment (python > 3.6) inside the technical demo folder, and install the requirements. If Jupyter Notebook is not present in the global Python installation, install it from [here](https://jupyter.org/install) or with "pip install notebook". 

Start Ganache (for more information concerning Ganache, have a look [here](quick_start_local_blockchain_dev.md)). Launch the Jupyter server with "jupyter notebook" in the `technical_demo` directory and inside the venv environment. Open the workbook `HybridTrustPLPKI.ipynb` in the browser interface.
